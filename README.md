This is a bookmarklet which lets you Crockfordize the web one page at a time.
It accomplishes this by overlaying Mr Crockford's beautiful face on some of the pages other images.

You can find a demo and a link to the bookmarklet [here](http://79.99.1.153/Crockfordize/demo.html)

This will only work in modern WebKit Browsers like Safari and Chrome.
